# DL_Pytorch_Torch
Deep Learning codes using Pytorch 
The time I created this repo, Pytorch though new was getting popular and Tensorflow was trying to catch up(eager execution).
Pytorch has dynamic computational graphs which makes it very much suitable for research work and people are developing high 
level APIs like fast.ai on top of Pytorch. This repo has been created with the aim of learning Pytorch and fastai. This started 
during the summers after the third year of iMtech under one of my institute's(IIITB) esteemed faculties Dr. Dinesh Babu Jayagopi
head of the MPL lab(mpl.iiitb.ac.in).
